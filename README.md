## Introduction
This repo is implementation of CORAL. Code is easy to understand. Some of the these codes are based on [BERT](https://github.com/codertimo/BERT-pytorch).   

## Quickstart
#### Your corpus should be prepared with a code snippet and its parsed AST. See examples in `./examples`.
#### You could generate your own AST with scripts from [py-150k](https://eth-sri.github.io/py150). 

### 1. Train your own CORAL
```
./train.sh
```
### 2. Test CORAL
```
./test.sh
```
